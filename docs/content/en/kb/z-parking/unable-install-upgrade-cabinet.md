  title: Unable to Install or Upgrade, Cabinet File is Corrupt
---
When you install or upgrade {{ en.RDM }}, you receive this error message below;
![!!KB4087](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_en_kb_KB4087.png)
## Solution
You have to deploy the *.zip file of {{ en.RDM }} in {{ en.RDM }} 's installation folder.

By default, {{ en.RDM }} is installed in **C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolutions\Remote Desktop Manager**.

When the file is downloaded, extract or copy/paste the content in the **C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolutions\Remote Desktop Manager** folder.

Restart {{ en.RDM }}, the latest version will be installed.

You can download the zip here; [https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/home/download](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/home/download)
