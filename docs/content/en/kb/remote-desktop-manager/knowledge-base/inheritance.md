Inheritance means that certain properties or attributes of a higher-level entry are automatically passed down to lower-level entries that inherit from it. This can be useful to set default attributes or even simplify management by only having to make changes at the inherited-level entry.  

Inheritance is accessible by going into ***Properties*** – ***Common*** – ***General*** – ***Credentials*** and selecting ***Inherited***.

If the credentials of the parent are not inherited properly, it indicates that one of the levels is not set to ***Inherited***.
