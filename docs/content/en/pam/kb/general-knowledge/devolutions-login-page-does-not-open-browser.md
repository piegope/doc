When trying to connect to a Devolutions product such as {{ en.DHUB }} or {{ en.DVLS }}, a connection page should open in your browser to allow you to enter your credentials. This window can sometimes be blocked by your browser or an extension installed on it. In this case, no error message is shown in the Devolutions product since the issue comes from the browser.

### Solution
First, change your browser or browser extension settings to remove or disable the setting that blocked the credentials prompt window. Try connecting again.

If that does not work, disable or delete the extension that causes the issue or change browser. Try connecting again.

If you still encouter issues, please [contact our support team](mailto:service@devolutions.net).
