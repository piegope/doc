  title: Devolutions Password Hub changes its name to {{ en.DHUB }}
---
We are excited to announce that our password management solution, Devolutions Password Hub, is changing its name to {{ en.DHUB }}! This rebranding effort is part of our ongoing mission to simplify and streamline our product portfolio.

While this change may come as a surprise, we want to assure you that it will not impact the quality or functionality of our product in any way. {{ en.DHUB }} will continue to offer the same robust features and benefits that you have come to know and trust.

We understand that some of you may be concerned about the transition process. Please know that this is a work in progress. We are currently updating our products, websites, and documentation to reflect this name change. However, for the time being, the two names will coexist. There is no need for you to take any action.
