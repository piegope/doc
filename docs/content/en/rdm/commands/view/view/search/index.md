The ***Search*** function allows you to search folders and entries in the database you are currently in.

When using the ***Search*** function, a tree view is also displayed, showing exactly where the results of your search are located in the database. Filter options are also available when clicking on the ellipsis button. Learn more about them in [Search/Filter](/rdm/windows/user-interface/status-bar/search-filter/).

It is also possible to do a ***Quick Search***, which allows you to search through the database without displaying the tree view. The results are therefore more concise.
