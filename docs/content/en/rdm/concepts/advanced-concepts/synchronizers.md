One of the notably time-consuming activities in {{ en.RDM }} involves populating [{{ en.VLT }}s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/) with the assets you intend to access. ***Synchronizers*** offer a solution by enabling the direct [import](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/import-export/) of information and sessions from a provider in the correct format. Automate {{ en.VLT }} upkeep and synchronization of external sources along with preserving [inheritance](/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/inheritance/) of objects.
