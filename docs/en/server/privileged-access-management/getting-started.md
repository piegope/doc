For more information, please refer to the [Scan Configurations](/server/privileged-access-management/scan-configurations/) topic. 

## Add vault in the pam vaults section 

In the ***PAM Vaults*** section of Administration - Privileged Accounts , you need to create at least one PAM Vault to contain the accounts. You can customize that particular [folder's security options](/server/privileged-access-management/accounts/) if you don't want to give them the defaults you set during the initial configuration. You can also [customize the approvers on the folder](/server/privileged-access-management/accounts/) directly which will give you a list of the administrators.

## Import accounts from a scan 

1. In the ***Scan Configuration*** section, click the result of your initial search. 
![View Scan Results](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/server/ServerUs6016.png) 
1. Select all the accounts you want to import, and on the top right, click the ***Import Selected Accounts*** button.  
![Import Selected Entries](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/server/ServerUs6017.png) 
1. You can put them in the vault of your choice. You can also choose whether to reset password on import or on check-in (recommended). That way, the password is safe the moment the user checks it back in.  
![Import Users](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/server/ServerUs6018.png) 
Once imported, you can click into the v ault and manually check the ***Synchronization Status*** in the top right of the screen. You will know the accounts are well synchronized when the credentials doesn't have an Out of sync red warning next to them.

You are now ready to use the privileged access management portion of {{ en.RDMS }} .
