## A note on Credentials 

Credentials in the {{ en.PVLT }} can be used in two ways:  

1. From a session in the {{ en.PVLT }} . 
1. When using the [User Specific Settings](/rdm/mac/commands/edit/setting-overrides/user-specific-settings/) feature  

These restrictions can easily be understood when you keep in mind that the {{ en.PVLT }} is in fact contained in the user area of the database. It must be used from within itself, or by using our extension mechanism that is user specific.
