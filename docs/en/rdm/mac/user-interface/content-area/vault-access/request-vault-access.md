You can request access to a public {{ en.VLT }} in {{ en.RDMMAC }}. Follow the steps below to complete a request.

1. If you have multiple data sources in {{ en.RDM }}, select the SQL data source that contains the {{ en.VLT }} you want access to in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***.
1. In the {{ en.VLT }} selector drop-down menu, click the ellipsis button to open a {{ en.VLT }} selection window.

1. If you are using a {{ en.DHUBB }} data source, select from the list an administrator / {{ en.VLT }} owner to send the request to. For other data source types, the request is sent to all administrators and {{ en.VLT }} owners.
1. Write a short message to the approver explaining why you want access to this {{ en.VLT }}. This is optional, but we recommend it as it allows them to make a more informed decision.
1. When you are done, click on ***Send Request***.
1. A message will appear indicating that the request has been sent to the approver. Click ***OK*** to make it disappear.

You now have to wait for the approver to respond to your request. If they approve your request, the {{ en.VLT }} will appear in the {{ en.VLT }} selector drop-down menu with the other {{ en.VLT }}s you already have access to.
