1. Move the window to the side in order to display the Remote Desktop Manager main window and refresh the data source by using the refresh button or by using File - Refresh . 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Holding the CTRL key while performing the refresh will force a full reload of the data source, thereby ignoring the cache. 
{% endsnippet %}
