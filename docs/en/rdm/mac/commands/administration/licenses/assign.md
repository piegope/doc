title: Assign Licenses
---
{{ en.RDM }} licenses are stored in the [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) located in ***Administration – Licenses***. Therefore there is no need to register {{ en.RDM }} locally as the license serial is retrieved directly from it. When launching the application for the first time, connect to the data source containing the serial.  

1. Manage and assign the user's licenses in ***Administration – Licenses***.

1. Select the license and click the ***Assign License to users*** icon.  
{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
If you have more than one license, our [Sales team](mailto:sales@devolutions.net?subject=Co-terminate%20all%20my%20RDM%20licenses) can provide a co-terminated renewal to facilitate your license management.

3. In the ***Assigned*** column, check next to each user you need to grant a license or use the global action buttons to assign to all or missing. 
{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
This step will automatically assign the license to the selected users, removing the need to interact with each user.

A warning window will open if you click ***Clear All*** and forget to assign the license to a user. Note that you can always go back to the ***Assign Licenses icon*** to assign the license.
