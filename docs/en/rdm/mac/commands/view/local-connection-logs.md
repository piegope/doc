  title: Local Connection Logs
---
When using {{ en.RDMMAC }} with a data source without a database or if you do not possess the correct permissions, the ***Activity Logs***, normally found in the ***View*** tab, are not available. In this situation, the ***Local Connection Logs*** appear in the ***View*** tab instead.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The ***Local Connection Logs*** replace the ***Activity Logs*** if you do not have the sufficient permissions to view them. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
### Local Connection Logs 
In the ***View*** section, you will find the ***Local Connection Logs*** feature, which is useful if you still want to access your local logs. Clicking on it opens a window containing all your local logs in chronological order (oldest to newest). You can scroll through the list to find the logs you are looking for. 
The buttons at the bottom of the window give you more options.
