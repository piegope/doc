  title: Move to another group/folder
---
If you wish to move an entry under a different Group or Folder you have the option of selecting your entry with your mouse and move it under the right Group or Folder, but to avoid easily made mistakes and move it under the wrong Group we highly suggest to use the option ***Move to Another Group/Folder***.

## Settings

1. Select your entry in your ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** and then use the menu ***Edit - Move to Another Group/Folder***.
