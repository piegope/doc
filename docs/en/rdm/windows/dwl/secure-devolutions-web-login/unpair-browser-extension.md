  title: Unpair a Browser Extension
---
In the event that you want to deny access to {{ en.RDM }} from a previously paired browser extension, you need to delete it from {{ en.RDM }}.  

1. In {{ en.RDM }}, go to ***File – Options – Browser Extensions***. 
1. In the ***{{ en.DWL }} Associations*** section, click the ***X*** button of the entry in the list, then click ***OK*** to save the modifications. 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
In the ***{{ en.DWL }} Associations*** section, you will find a list of each association made to {{ en.RDM }}, including some information to identify them. This includes the name specified at the time of the association (which defaults to the web browser’s name), a part of the encryption key used between the two, its creation date, and the date when it was last used.
