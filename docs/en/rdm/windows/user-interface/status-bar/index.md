## Online/Offline toggle 

This feature is indicated by the green globe between the version label and the Grab input toggle. Clicking it will change your connection between offline and online (for {{ en.RDM }} only). You can tell which connection state you are currently using by the color of the globe. Green is online and orange is offline.
