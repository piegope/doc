A shortcut is the reiteration of an existing entry. In contrast to a duplicated entry, which has its own ID and properties, a shortcut is a link to an entry and its properties. You can create shortcuts easily by r ***ight-clicking the entry*** ***Edit – Create Shortcut*** ***or by using the aforementioned button in the*** ***Edit*** ***tab.***   There are a few scenarios where a user would want to use the same entry differently, such as connecting to two different hosts with a single RDP session.  

For example, it is possible to:  

* Assign different access to the same entry. 
* Create a favorite folder with everything centralized. 
* Reuse a document for different scenarios.  
![These two entries are the exactly the same](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/clip10209.png) 

Entries reiterated this way also have both folder paths indicated in their Folder field in their properties, the paths are separated by a semi-colon. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
There is no visual differences between the shortcut and the original entry. Therefore, you’ll need to delete all entries to completely remove said entry. You will be asked for confirmation when attempting to delete said shortcut.

The ***Play List*** feature in {{ en.RDM }} is a lot like a music play list. It opens a list of entries, in a specific order, automatically.The Play List can be used to create groups of sessions for a specific task or for security reasons. You can build your own Play List and start all entries from a Play List at the same time.
