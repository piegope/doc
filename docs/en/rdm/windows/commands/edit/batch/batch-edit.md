The ***Batch Edit*** feature changes the settings of multiple entries in one operation. For example, it can be used to remove or update the credentials of a group of sessions.

## Advanced Search Selection 

Select multiple entries by using the usual Ctrl/Shift+left-click, etc. For a method with a little more power, use the [***Advanced Search***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/panels/search/advanced/) feature, which allows to select multiple entries at once, based on the defined criteria. The ***Advanced Search*** is available in ***View – Advanced Search***. If required, you can achieve similar results with the [***Multi Vault Search***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/panels/search/multi-vault/).

Click ***Select in {{ en.NPANE }}*** to select the same entries as in the ***Advanced Search*** dialog. Then use ***Edit – Batch Edit*** to edit all the selected entries. Go to [this topic](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/batch-edit-rdm/) for the steps.
