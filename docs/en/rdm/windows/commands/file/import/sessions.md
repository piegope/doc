You can go to File – Import – Sessions to import sessions from other software into {{ en.RDM }}. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The import feature is only active if the import ***Privilege*** has been enabled inside the user account. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
You can import your sessions from an existing application or an existing file format. Some applications encrypt the data, but it must be in plain text to allow the application to parse the content. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
All entries will be imported in the current folder. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldCaution %} 
For some applications, it is not possible to extract the password. 
{% endsnippet %}
