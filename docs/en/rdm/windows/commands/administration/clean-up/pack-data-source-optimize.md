title: Pack Data Source (Optimize)
---
When holding a great number of entries in your data source it is a best practice to compress them to avoid slowness issues when using your data source. The ***Data Source (Optimize)*** will analyze all your entries, compress them and then re-saves them, thus saving space in your data source. 

## Settings 

1. Open the data source you wish to optimize. In ***Administration***, click on ***Pack Data Source (Optimize)*** and then click on ***Analyze***.

1. Once the Analyze is completed click on ***Optimize*** to proceed with the optimization of your data source. You can select which ***{{ en.VLT }}*** you wish to ***Analyze*** and ***Optimize***, or use the ***Optimize All*** feature to perform the ***Optimize*** action on all available ***{{ en.VLT }}s***.
