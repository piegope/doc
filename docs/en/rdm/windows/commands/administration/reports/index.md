From this window, you can browse and select a wide variety of Report Types. Explore to your heart's content.  

Once Generated, a report will provide you with all the information you selected during this step. These final results can take various shapes and have different features (such as editing a specific entry or printing the result) depending on what the report actually is.

These logs are still restricted by user rights. A user with restricted access would not be able to select Password and Security for example.
