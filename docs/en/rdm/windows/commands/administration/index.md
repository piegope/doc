Opens the {{ en.VLT }} Settings. The {{ en.VLT }} Folder is the one at the top of the navigation pane (in Tree View). It is the one from which all entries and folder stem. By default, lower level folders inherit settings and security from parent folder until reaching the {{ en.VLT }} . Therefore, using permissions on the {{ en.VLT }} folder allows to secure all entries below the {{ en.VLT }} level. Refer to [Default security for entries](/rdm/windows/commands/administration/settings/vault-settings/default-security-entries/) for more information.
