title: Import Multiple Vaults
---
The ***Import Multiple Vaults (.rdx)*** function lets you import one or more vaults at a time. Learn how in this [topic](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/export-import-vaults/) .  

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
The vaults you want to import must have been previously exported using the ***Export All Vaults (.rdx)*** , because they need to be in the .rdx format.
