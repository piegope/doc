The Advanced Search allows you to search for entries and folders based on multiple criteria in one vault at a time. To search multiple vaults simultaneously, please refer to the [***Multi Vault Search***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/panels/search/multi-vault/) topic.

It is possible to select multiple entries at once by shift-clicking or all of them with the Ctrl+A shortcut. Right-clicking one or more entries shows the same menu and options as in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** .
