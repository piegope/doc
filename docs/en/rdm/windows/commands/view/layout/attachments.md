The attachment type and size are limited only by your bandwidth and the data source. You can also view a saved attachment:  

* from the session context menu; 
* from the session properties; or 
* directly on the ***Dashboard*** . 

The refresh button allows you to update directly the selected document. Use it to save your local modifications. 

### Actions 
Use the toolbar above the attachments list to manage the selected attachment.
