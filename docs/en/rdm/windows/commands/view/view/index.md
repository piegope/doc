The ***View*** section in the ***View*** tab allows you to access different lists and information as well as to quickly connect to a host.  
![View Section](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2015.png) 

### Quick Connect 

The ***Quick Connect*** feature allows you to open an ad-hoc session by specifying the host and session type. For more information, visit [***Quick Connect***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/quick-connect/). 

### Activity Logs 

The ***Activity Logs*** feature opens a tab containing information about user activity in the selected data source. For more information, visit [***Activity Logs***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/activity-logs/). 

### Lists 

Multiple list types are available in the ***View*** section: ***Credential List***, ***Macros/Scripts/Tools List***, ***Synchronizer List***, and ***VPN List***. These options open a window showing a tree view of all entries of the specific entry type in the database. The lists can be filtered using the search bar. Right-clicking on an item shows the same menu and options as in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***.

### Tab Groups 

The ***Tab Groups*** feature opens a docked window showing a tree view of the various tab groups. It is possible to select multiple tabs at once by <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking or all of them with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> shortcut. Right-clicking on one or more tabs shows more options.  

The other ***Tab groups*** will only appear if a session that is part of a tab group (other than the ***All*** tab) is active.

Although it is docked by default, the ***Tab Groups*** pane can be windowed, dragged, and docked anywhere within {{ en.RDM }}.  

To learn how to create a tab group, refer to [***Grouped Tab Bar***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/layout/grouped-tab-bar/). 

### Notification 

The ***Notification*** feature opens a window showing the various notifications (such as expired or about to be expired entries or tasks). Right-clicking on a notification shows more options. If you double-click on an "expired license" notification, a browser page opens to take you to your {{ en.DVLS }} account. Notifications can be sorted or searched by ***Text***, ***Source***, ***Folder***, ***Level***, ***Type***, ***Date***, ***Time***, or ***Days***.

### Message 

The ***Message*** feature opens a window to let you access your messages. You can double-click on a message to open it. Messages can be sorted or searched by ***Seen***, ***From***, ***Subject***, ***File***, ***Date***, or ***Expiration Date***.
