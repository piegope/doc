## A note on Credentials 

Credentials in the {{ en.PVLT }} can be used in two ways:  

1. From a session using the ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** ***search*** . 
1. When using the ***User Specific Settings*** feature. 

These restrictions can easily be understood when you keep in mind that the {{ en.PVLT }} is in fact contained in the user area of the database. It must be used from within the {{ en.PVLT }} , or by using our extension mechanism that is user specific.
