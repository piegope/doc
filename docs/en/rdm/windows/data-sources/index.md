The data sources are at the heart of {{ en.RDM }}. They are the container that holds entries. 

## Settings 

A data source can be a local file or a database (either local or shared). Multiple data sources can be managed at the same time as seen below.

## Create a data source 

Please consult [Create a new data source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/create-new-data-source/) for more information. 

## Multiple data sources 

Multiple data sources can be configured, but there is only one active at a time.  

Switch from one data source to another by using the data source drop down list.

## Data Source Settings (System Settings) 

[Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) can manage a lot more settings related to the database and security. Those settings are saved directly in the database. For more information, please consult [Data Source Settings (System Settings)](/rdm/windows/commands/administration/settings/system-settings/general/).
