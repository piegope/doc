title: Set up a Team Folder for Default Settings
---
You must create a team folder on a server drive to store your default settings templates in order to share them with your team.  

## Settings 

1. Start by accessing your server drive (such as \\servercommon) and create a new team folder to hold all your team default settings templates.

1. Go to File - Options - Path and enter the path of your newly created folder stored on your server drive. All your default templates will then automatically be saved in that folder.

1. If you have remote workers, ensure they have access to the shared server in offline mode. Map your network drive and then follow the instructions [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-sync-center) for the offline mode access when using Windows 11/10.
