title: Companion Tools Access
---
As an administrator to your {{ en.HUBB }}, you can disable or enable the use of {{ en.CTOOLS }} for specific users that are not administrators.  

{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
To reduce the number of inquiries from your users, we recommend that you inform them before changing their access to {{ en.HUB }} via their {{ en.CTOOLS }}, especially if you disable their access. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
These settings can be configured in ***Administration – Users*** when [creating and inviting a user](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/management/users/create-invite-users/) or after the fact by editing the user. This only affects the user for whom the settings have been changed.  

Access to {{ en.CTOOLS }} can be configured separately for {{ en.DWL }} and {{ en.DWS }}. The settings are enabled by default.
