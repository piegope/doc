  title: Devolutions Web Login user interface with {{ en.HUBB }}
---
The {{ en.DWL }} user interface is slightly different in your browser depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with the extension. This topic will present the {{ en.DWL }} user interface when used with {{ en.HUBB }}.  

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening {{ en.DWL }} in your browser, can be divided into three main sections:  

1. The ***Top Menu*** gives you access to some {{ en.DWL }} functionalities and settings. 
1. The ***Side Menu*** is directly linked to the central panel, as each tab changes what is displayed in the window depending on its function. 
1. The ***Content Area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {{ en.DWL }} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs.

### Top Menu 

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Data Source Selector*** at the left of the ***Top Menu*** . A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with {{ en.DWL }} .
