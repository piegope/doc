## Solution
You will get the user mismatch message when you configure a user but connect with a different user, usually via this form:  
![!!KB4962](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB4962.png)  
The ***Username*** specified in the data source configuration and the user selected via the form above must match.
